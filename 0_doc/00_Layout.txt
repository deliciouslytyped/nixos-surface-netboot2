Hello.
Yes this is doc. :V

configuration.nix
`````````````````
configuration.nix is located in the root of the repository. The intention is to make functional
the tools that expect configuration.nix to be in the location determined by the default `NIX_PATH`,
namely /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

Specifically, `nixos-rebuild` and `nixos-option` are intended to work.


configurations
``````````````
This directory contains system configurations, such as for containers or top level systems.
Such system configurations must be places in this directory, if you want the configuration to be
able to handle `inner` systems, and to enable the nix tooling in them. (??clarify)

- impure.nix, impure, impure/system

The repository is (intended to be) designed such that all sources of mutable state ("impurity") in
the configuration are purified into function arguments/module attrs in this file. An example of
this is reading the `impure/system` file, to determine which system configuration to use, and then
importing the appropriate system configuration module.

Beyond this, all files as a matter of policy (are intended to:) must use full and explicit pinning.

containers
``````````
This directory contains nix files to be used by `extra-container` for semi-imperative containers.
(`extra-container` uses the declarative containers mechanism, but manages the containers separate
from your system's /etc/nixos/configuration.nix)/

Note the containers that are intended to be run at the top level have shebang lines and are runnable.
See `lib/shebang.nix` for argument processing or pass literally `-h` as the first argument to get
the (admittedly limited) usage instructions.

lib
```
Misc. nix files.

- container-outerset.nix, contains settings for enabling nix tooling in containers and nested
containers (note that nested containers in configurations like this, use the host systems nix daemon)

-

netboot
```````
Code for netboot services in the pxe_server container

nix
```
This structure is required for niv to work. niv's pinning files live here.

patches
```````
Containes patches; currently for extra-container (??some weird pinning thing I'm doing that may be
unwarranted), and `modules/virtualisation/nixos-container` (minimal ipvlan support).

secrets
```````
Exists but is not included in this repo.
